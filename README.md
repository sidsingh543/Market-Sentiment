# Market-Sentiment
Market-Sentiment is a full end-to-end pipeline designed to forecast short-term stock price movements by combining natural language processing, stochastic modeling, and machine learning. The system ingests live financial news from NewsAPI and price data from Yahoo Finance, cleans and stores them in SQL, and applies sentiment analysis on headlines and article text to quantify market mood in real time. These sentiment features are integrated with stochastic stock price models, including Geometric Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo simulations, to estimate volatility and generate probability bands around expected price paths. On top of this foundation, predictive models such as XGBoost and Logistic Regression are trained to classify the direction of price movement, achieving 75% directional accuracy (AUC = 0.80) on historical testing. The entire workflow is automated and deployed with a Streamlit dashboard that overlays sentiment signals and simulation forecasts onto live price charts, providing traders and analysts with a clear, interactive view of evolving market conditions. This project demonstrates the integration of NLP, quantitative finance, and real-time data engineering into a single production-style pipeline.
